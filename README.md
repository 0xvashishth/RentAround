<!-- ## Description -->

## About 
In today's scenarios, students and people may face housing issues, so we devised a solution: we created ***Rent Around***, a website where they can find accomodation in a convenient location and rent directly from this website and can directly contact the owners of the house.

<br>

## Features ðŸ’»
- This website has great features for both users and renters.
Renters can add their properties, edit them, and view their current status. The user can check the availability of houses in a specific area and contact the renter directly.


<br>

## Future Modification ðŸ”­
In the future, we may add chat functionality so that users can directly chat with renters, as well as payment, a more user-friendly UI, and the ability for renters to track records.
